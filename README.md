# Web-ProxyServer
Socket Programming: HTTP Web Proxy Server (without POST)
Python version 3.8 (developed on 32-bit) 
[MSC V.1996 32 bit (Intel)] on Win32

&& PyCharm Community Edition 2020.1 x64

## Running the Code
- `py -3 server.py`

This boots the Python server which binds its socket to port 5005.

## Testing the Code
- Go to `http://localhost:5005/www.google.com/` in the console
- This will load the page, from cache if possible, else from the server
- Try `http://localhost:5005/gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file4.html`
